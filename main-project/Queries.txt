1)Find all employee with highest to lowest salary

SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees
ORDER BY salary DESC;


//Fixed and working! woo
2) Find all employee working on more than 1 project or zero project

SELECT name
FROM Employees
WHERE SIN NOT IN(SELECT WorkerSIN FROM WorksOn) OR SIN = (SELECT WorkerSIN FROM WorksOn GROUP BY WorkerSIN HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

//Fixed and a o kay! (da wae)
3) Find employee being supervised by supervisor

SELECT Employees.name
FROM Employees, Supervises
WHERE SubordinateSIN = Employees.SIN;

1. Inserting/updating/tuples to relations/tables in your database. Examples of such tables include Projects, Employees, Departments, etc. The system should also allow operations of insert/update/delete of tuples and/or attributes. For example, we should be able to update attribute “Hours worked”, which is used to calculate the stipend of employees based on the hours she/he worked on different projects, considering the “hourly” charge for each employee (it is not necessary the same for all employees). 

2. Who works under which employee,

SELECT name, managerSIN
FROM Employees, Supervises
WHERE SubordinateSIN = SIN;

How much each employee gets, 

SELECT name, salary
FROM Employees;

In what stage a project is (considering for instance 4 levels: preliminary, intermediate, advanced, and complete)

SELECT name, stage
FROM Projects
WHERE stage = 'preliminary'; 

*stage is to be changed depending on level wanted*

Who works on which project; 

SELECT Employees.name, Projects.name
FROM Employees, Projects, WorksOn
WHERE WorksOn.WorkerSIN = Employees.SIN AND Projects.ID = WorksOn.projectID;

List the project managed by each department? 

SELECT Projects.name, Departments.name
FROM Projects, Departments
WHERE Projects.DeptID = Departments.ID;

3. Each employee is involved in most and least number projects? 

// least number of projects
SELECT name, 0 AS NoOfProjects
FROM Employees
WHERE SIN NOT IN(SELECT WorkerSIN FROM WorksOn);

4. What is the total pay for each project?

SELECT Projects.name,SUM(salary)
FROM Employees, WorksOn, Projects
WHERE Projects.ID = WorksOn.ProjectID
GROUP BY ProjectID;

For each department? 

SELECT Departments.name, SUM(salary)
FROM Employees, Departments
WHERE DeptNumber = Departments.ID
GROUP BY DeptNumber;

For the company in a certain period? 

5. Which department manager is also the manager of some projects?

SELECT DISTINCT Employees.name
FROM Employees, Projects, Manages
WHERE Projects.ManagerID = Manages.ManagerSIN AND ManagerSIN = Employees.SIN;
