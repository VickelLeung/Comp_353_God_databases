1. Inserting/updating/tuples to relations/tables in your database. Examples of such tables include Projects, Employees, Departments, etc. The system should also allow operations of insert/update/delete of tuples and/or attributes. For example, we should be able to update attribute “Hours worked”, which is used to calculate the stipend of employees based on the hours she/he worked on different projects, considering the “hourly” charge for each employee (it is not necessary the same for all employees). 
2. Queries like who works under which employee, 
How much each employee gets, 
In what stage a project is (considering for instance 4 levels: preliminary, intermediate, advanced, and complete)
 Who works on which project; 
List the project managed by each department? 
3. Each employee is involved in most and least number projects? 
4. What is the total pay for each project?
 For each department? 
For the company in a certain period? 
5. Which department manager is also the manager of some projects? 6. Etc…
