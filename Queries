Every student has to be a member of exactly one team. 
Each team is assigned one demo slot, identified by date and time. 
No team may have more than 4 members.  
The leader of a team is unique if exists. It will be null otherwise.  

E/R model of the database


1. Which student(s) is not a member of any team? 

SELECT Name
FROM Student, Members
WHERE Student.SID not in (SELECT SID FROM Members);

2. For each team, list its members. 


###############REVISE don’t think its good############# 
SELECT Name, Members.TID
FROM Student, Members, Teams
WHERE Student.SID = Members.SID AND Teams.TID = Members.TID;

SELECT Student.Name
FROM Student, Members, Teams
WHERE Members.SID = Student.SID AND Teams.TID = Members.TID;

3. Who was not present in the demo of a team? 



4. List the teams which that have <4 members. 
SELECT TID
FROM Teams
WHERE NoOfMembers < 4

5.Given a TID, list the names of the members.
*********************************************************************
SELECT Name, TID
FROM Student, Members
WHERE # = Members.TID AND Student.SID = Members.SID;

SELECT Name
FROM Student, Members
WHERE int[placeholder] = Members.TID and Student.SID = Members.SID;

6. Given a date, list all the teams that have demos on that day.
SELECT TID
FROM Demos
WHERE date = "given date...";

7.For each team that is not complete (<4 members), list the TID and the capacity to increase. (That is, if a team has 1 member, the capacity to increase would be 3). 

SELECT TID
FROM 

8.Given a student Name or ID, find his/her team ID.
****************************************** Only did for ID need to find how to also with name **********************************
SELECT TID
FROM Members, Student
WHERE 9 = Members.SID OR (SELECT Student.SID AS theID into @myVar FROM Student;) theID = Members.SID;

9. Given a student Name or ID, find the names and SID of his/her teammates.
